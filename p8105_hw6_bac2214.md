## Question 1

In this first step, here is what I did:

- A city_state variable was created.
- A binary variable homicide_solved was added to indicate whether the
  homicide is solved.
- Homicides from the cities Dallas, TX; Phoenix, AZ; Kansas City, MO
  were omitted.
- The analysis was limited to cases where victim_race is white or black.
- victim_age was converted to a numeric format (and non-numeric values
  were coerced into NAs).

``` r
homicide_df = read_csv("data/homicide-data.csv") |> 
   mutate(
    city_state = paste(city, state, sep = ", "),
    homicide_solved = ifelse(grepl("closed", disposition, ignore.case = TRUE), 1, 0)
  ) |> 
  filter(!city_state %in% c("Dallas, TX", "Phoenix, AZ", "Kansas City, MO", "Tulsa, AL")) %>%
  filter(victim_race %in% c("White", "Black")) |> 
  mutate(victim_age = as.numeric(victim_age))
```

    ## Warning: There was 1 warning in `mutate()`.
    ## â„¹ In argument: `victim_age = as.numeric(victim_age)`.
    ## Caused by warning:
    ## ! NAs introduced by coercion

In the next step, I attempt to make the log regression for Baltimore,
MD.

``` r
baltimore_df = filter(homicide_df, city_state == "Baltimore, MD")

baltimore_log_model = glm(homicide_solved ~ victim_age + victim_sex + victim_race, 
                       data = baltimore_df, family = binomial())

baltimore_log_model |> 
  broom::tidy() |> 
  mutate(OR = exp(estimate)) |>
  select(term, log_OR = estimate, OR, p.value) |> 
  knitr::kable(digits = 3)
```

| term             | log_OR |    OR | p.value |
|:-----------------|-------:|------:|--------:|
| (Intercept)      |  0.664 | 1.942 |    0.00 |
| victim_age       | -0.005 | 0.995 |    0.11 |
| victim_sexMale   | -1.037 | 0.355 |    0.00 |
| victim_raceWhite |  0.900 | 2.459 |    0.00 |

**Key findings:**

- Intercept *(not interpretable)*: The odds of a homicide being solved
  when the victim is a 0-yars old, black female is 1.92.
- For every one year increase in age, we expect the odds of their
  homicide being solved to decrease by 0.995
- The odds of a male victim having their homicide solved is 0.355 times
  the odds of a women having their homicide solved, holding all other
  factors constant. \*Being white significantly increases the odds of
  their homicide being solved, compared to being black.
- Victim age does not appear to be a significant predictor at the common
  0.05 significance level (p\>0.05).
